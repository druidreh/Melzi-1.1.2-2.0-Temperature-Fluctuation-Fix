# V1.1.2 Fix

So to start off I want to note that the CR-10 I'm working with is actually from my work, but since I'm the only one who knows much about 3D printing in the office, I'm the one using it all the time (I am also the one who suggested getting this specific printer). We bought it from Banggood.com and it seems as though the seller knew about the temperature issues because the board we received had a capacitor already in place as seen in the image below.

The capacitor they put is a 100uF 16V capacitor across the ground and coltage pins of EXT-A2 (the signal pin of which corresponds to pin 29 on this board) which I've outlined here:

## What you need

- Creality Melzi V1.1.2 circuit board
- Any capacitor over 16V and around or more than 400uf
- Soldering iron + solder
- Solder sucker

## Replacing the Capacitor

This is actually very straight forward, remove the capacitor with your soldering iron and sucker and simply replace it with a larger one. I used a 470uF 25V capacitor like so:

</p>

**WARNING: These are polarized capacitors so make sure the pins are soldered correctly. Typically the pin with the gray stripe down the side is the ground pin, it is also usually shorter.**

I originally wanted to use pin 29 to drive a servo so I soldered pins in parallel to the capacitor as well as you can see here

## You are done

Well that's really it. I can now print PETG reliably after tuning my PID and my hotend holds temperature beautifully. I hope this helped, may your filament always be dry and your extrusion always consistent!
