# V1.1.2 Fix

So to start off I want to note that the CR-10 I'm working with is actually from my work, but since I'm the only one who knows much about 3D printing I'm the one using it all the time. We bought it from Banggood.com and it seems as though the seller knew about the temperature issues because the board we received had a capacitor already in place.
