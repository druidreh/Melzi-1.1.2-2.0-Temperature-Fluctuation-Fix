# V1.1.2 Fix

So to start off I want to note that the CR-10 I'm working with is actually from my work, but since I'm the only one who knows much about 3D printing in the office, I'm the one using it all the time (I am also the one who suggested getting this specific printer). We bought it from Banggood.com and it seems as though the seller knew about the temperature issues because the board we received had a capacitor already in place as seen in the image below.



Now as you can see the capacitor is placed on the ground and voltage pins of the EXT-A2 (the signal pin of which corresponds to pin 29 on this board).
